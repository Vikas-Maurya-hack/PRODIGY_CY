# üîê Image Encryption Tool

A simple yet powerful GUI-based image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to secure your images. This tool demonstrates the basics of image encryption and serves as a foundation for understanding image steganography and data hiding concepts.

## üåü Features

- **Simple Pixel Manipulation Encryption**: Uses RGB value shifting for encryption/decryption
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Clean, modern interface built with Tkinter
- **Multiple Image Formats**: Supports PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, and GIF
- **Real-time Preview**: Side-by-side comparison of original and processed images
- **Customizable Encryption Key**: Choose any key between 1-255
- **Save Functionality**: Export encrypted/decrypted images in various formats

## üì∏ Screenshots

### Main Interface
The tool features a clean, dark-themed interface with easy-to-use controls:

- **File Selection**: Browse and select images to encrypt/decrypt
- **Key Input**: Enter encryption key (1-255)
- **Action Buttons**: Encrypt, decrypt, and save operations
- **Image Preview**: Side-by-side view of original and processed images

## üöÄ How It Works

### Encryption Process
1. **Load Image**: The tool converts the image to RGB format
2. **Pixel Manipulation**: Adds the encryption key to each pixel's RGB values
3. **Modulo Operation**: Uses modulo 256 to keep values within valid range (0-255)
4. **Result**: Creates an encrypted image that looks like random noise

### Decryption Process
1. **Load Encrypted Image**: Load the previously encrypted image
2. **Reverse Operation**: Subtracts the same encryption key from pixel values
3. **Modulo Operation**: Ensures values stay within valid range
4. **Result**: Recovers the original image (if correct key is used)

### Mathematical Formula
```
Encryption: Encrypted_Pixel = (Original_Pixel + Key) % 256
Decryption: Original_Pixel = (Encrypted_Pixel - Key) % 256
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing
- NumPy for array operations
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Clone from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-tool.git
cd image-encryption-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
python image_encryption_tool.py
```

### Option 2: Download ZIP
1. Download the ZIP file from GitHub
2. Extract to your desired location
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python image_encryption_tool.py
   ```

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Step 1: Launch the Application
```bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
```

### Step 2: Select an Image
- Click "Browse Image" button
- Choose any supported image file (PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF)
- The image will appear in the "Original Image" panel

### Step 3: Set Encryption Key
- Enter a number between 1-255 in the "Encryption Key" field
- Higher numbers create more scrambled results
- **Remember this key** - you'll need it to decrypt!

### Step 4: Encrypt/Decrypt
- **To Encrypt**: Click "üîí Encrypt Image"
- **To Decrypt**: Click "üîì Decrypt Image"
- The result appears in the "Processed Image" panel

### Step 5: Save Result
- Click "üíæ Save Result" to save the processed image
- Choose your preferred format and location

## üîí Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Information**:

- This tool is for **educational purposes** and basic privacy needs
- The encryption method is **simple pixel manipulation** - not cryptographically secure
- For sensitive data, use proper encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)
- Always keep your encryption key secure and remember it
- Without the correct key, decryption will produce incorrect results
